I have a diploma in economics, and currently, I discovered that I am passionate about finding other people's mistakes and thinking outside of the box. So, what job can be better than QA Tester?

I  finished a Software Tester Course at the Informal School of IT where I learned about manual testing, a bit of automation testing, agile methodologies, writing test cases and bug reports, API testing, and basic SQL.

I want an opportunity to learn, evolve, and work.
